# spark-experiments

Personal repo for experimenting with learning materials for the book Learning Spark, 2nd ed.

Unmodified code in the original repo: https://github.com/databricks/LearningSparkV2

## To discuss

How to run on Win?

- mingw / does'nt work, ps does not have an o param haha
- wsl / seems hacky, JDK should be installed within WSL and using that instead of the Win one would be confusing

UI - extra stats?
onheap / offheap? http://localhost:4040/executors/
	exec loss reason?
